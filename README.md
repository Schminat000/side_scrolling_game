# Overview

The game is incomplete; however, I plan on making it a functional and fun game! You are a little fox and you can run around and jump. This provides the basics for a game to be made in the future.

I created this game so that I could start learning how to become a game developer. I am passionate about video games and wanted to make a simple 2D side-scroller. I love side-scrollers and am excited to continue to learn more. This project really helped me learn more about what it take to develop games. I am excited to learn more tools in the future to help fine tune these skills. I hope to take these skills I've learned from this project onto the next one.

# Development Environment

I used Unreal Engine to compile all the downloaded assets in order to create a demo game.

* Unreal Engine
* Visual Studio Code
* Git/GitHub
* SunnyLand Assets
* YouTube

# Future Work

* The thing I want to accomplish most is to create a 2D/3D hybrid game soon.
* I want to and plan to improve the amount of time I spent into this project. I plan to add more levels, details, and more.
* I want to learn Blender and make my own assets/sprites to use to truly make it more uniquely mine.
* I want to add more things to do by adding RPG elements. For example: story, quests, bosses, and timed speed-running.
* Last thing that I want to improve is learning more fun tools to use in Unreal Engine or even try creating this game in Unity instead as it is more geared towards 2D side-scrollers.
